# Code Guardian Directory Skip Marker
#
# The presence of this file (.cg-ignore) tells Code Guardian to completely skip
# this directory and all its subdirectories when auto-discovering configuration files.
#
# This is useful for:
# - Example configurations that shouldn't be enforced
# - Test fixtures and mock rules
# - Third-party code with their own rules
# - Any directory you want Code Guardian to ignore
#
# Note: The content of this file is not parsed. Only its presence matters.
